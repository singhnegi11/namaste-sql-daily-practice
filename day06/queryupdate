--full outer join 

A FULL JOIN (also called FULL OUTER JOIN) is a type of SQL join that returns all rows from both tables, matching rows where possible, and filling in NULLs where there is no match.

✅ What it does in simple terms

Returns all records from Table A
Returns all records from Table B
Matches rows using the join condition
If a row has no match in the other table, the result still includes it, with NULL values for the missing side

Yes — it will still show the remaining employees from the department table, even if you select the employee ID from the employee table, as long as you are using a FULL JOIN.
Let’s break this down step‑by‑step so it’s 100% clear.


SELECT COALESCE(employee.emp_id, department.emp_id) AS emp_id
FROM employee
FULL OUTER JOIN department
ON employee.emp_id = department.emp_id;


with cte as (select r.c_id,p.name as mother_name from people p
inner join relations r on r.p_id=p.id
where p.gender = 'F'),
cte2 as (select r.c_id,p.name as father_name from people p
inner join relations r on r.p_id=p.id
where p.gender = 'M'),
cte3 as (select coalesce(ct.c_id,ct2.c_id) as cid,ct.mother_name,ct2.father_name from cte ct 
full outer join cte2 ct2 on ct.c_id=ct2.c_id)
select p.name as child_name, ct3.mother_name,ct3.father_name from cte3 ct3
inner join people p on ct3.cid = p.id
order by child_name
