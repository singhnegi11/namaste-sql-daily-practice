--always remeber when dealing with dates , if minute and second are invloved then take consieration of converting into minite and second dont take the hour value,like in below example 
with cte as (select emp_id, 
sum(case when datediff(second,login,logout)/3600 >= 8  then 1 else 0 end) as cond1,
sum(case when datediff(second,login,logout)/3600 >= 10  then 1 else 0 end) as cond2
 
from employees
group by emp_id)

select emp_id,case when cond1>=3 and cond2>= 2 then 'both'
                   when cond1>=3 then '1'
                   when cond2>='2' then '2'  end as criterian from cte
